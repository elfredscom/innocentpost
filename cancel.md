# Cancellation & Refund Policy

Innocent Post will provide the Services to you at the rates and for the fees (“Fees”) described at appropriate places. The Fees include charges for Transactions, processing Payments, and for other events connected with your Account. We may revise the Fees at any time by providing notice through the website or email. Your continued use shall imply consent to the same. You agree that we are authorized to deduct our fees, any applicable reversal amounts, and/or any amounts you owe us from available sources.

You can cancel your subscription by clicking on "Manage Existing Subscription" on the [Homepage](/) or request a refund by contacting [Support](/support).

Since we spend time, effort, labor, and other costs on providing you with the Services, we may have limited ability to refund once the work has been started. As and when you react out for service cancellation/refund, the refund amount will be calculated by us on the basis of work hours spent on your specific project and any specific costs incurred to support the provision of such work. Our decision will be final and binding. The subscription will be canceled and no further charges will be levied from the next period.

In case of an unauthorized payment or mistake due to our error, we shall at your request refund the payment amount including all fees deducted by us.
